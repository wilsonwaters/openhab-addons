# OpenSprinkler Binding

This binding allows allows basic control of the OpenSprinkler devices.
Stations can be controlled to be turned on or off and rain sensor state can be read.

## Supported Bridges

*   HTTP (`http`) - The http bridge allows to communicate with an OpenSprinkler device through the network

## Supported Things

*   OpenSprinkler Station (`station`) - to control a single station of a device, e.g. to turn it on or off
*   OpenSprinkler Device (`device`) - for getting device-specific infos, e.g. if rain was detected

## Discovery

OpenSprinkler devices can be manually discovered by sending a request to every IP on the network.
Discovery needs to be run manually as this is a brute force method of finding devices that can saturate network or device available bandwidth.

## Thing Configuration

OpenSprinkler using the HTTP interface

```
Bridge opensprinkler:http:http [hostname="127.0.0.1", port=80, password="opendoor", refresh=60] {
    Thing station 01 [stationIndex=1]
}
```

-   hostname: Hostname or IP address of the OpenSprinkler HTTP API.
-   port: Port the OpenSprinkler device is listening on. Usually 80.
-   password: Admin password of the API. Factory default is: opendoor
-   refresh: Number of seconds in between refreshing the Thing state with the API.
-   basicUsername: (optional) Only needed when the OpenSprinkler device is behind a basic auth enforcing reverse proxy.
-   basicPassword: (optional) Only needed when the OpenSprinkler device is behind a basic auth enforcing reverse proxy.

### Station Thing Configuration

The `station` thing can be used with both bridge and has the following configuration properties:

-   stationIndex: The index of the station to communicate with, starting with 0 for the first station

## Channels

The following channel is supported by the `station` thing.

| Channel Type ID    | Item Type   |    | Description                                              |
|--------------------|-------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| stationState       | Switch      | RW | This channel indicates whether station 01 is on or off.  |
| remainingWaterTime | Number:Time | R  | The time the station remains to be open.                 |
| nextDuration       | Number:Time | RW | A configuration item, which time, if linked, will be     |
|                    |             |    | used as the time the station will be kept open when      |
|                    |             |    | switched on. It is advised to add persistence for items  |
|                    |             |    | linked to this channel, the binding does not persist     |
|                    |             |    | values of it.                                            |
| queued             | Switch      | RW | Indicates that the station is queued to be turned on.    |
|                    |             |    | The channel cannot be turned on, only turning it off is  |
|                    |             |    | supported (which removes the station from the queue).    |

When using the `nextDuration` channel, it is advised to setup persistence (e.g. MapDB) in order to persist the value through restarts.

The following is supported by the `device` thing, but only when connected using the http interface.

| Channel Type ID | Item Type              |    | Description                                                               |
|-----------------|------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| rainsensor      | Switch                 | RO | This channel indicates whether rain is detected by the device or not.     |
| currentDraw     | Number:ElectricCurrent | RO | Shows the current draw of the device. If the device does not have sensors |
|                 |                        |    | for this metric, the channel will not be available.                       |
