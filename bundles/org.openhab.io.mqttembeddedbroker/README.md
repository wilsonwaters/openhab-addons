# MQTT Broker Moquette

**Attention:** Moquette is no longer maintained upstream and this add-on is therefore considered deprecated in openHAB. 
It is recommended to switch to an external broker like mosquitto.
The Moquette add-on will be removed in a future release of openHAB.

MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol.
It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

To allow MQTT capable devices to communicate with each other you need a software called MQTT Broker.

You can either install one of the many MQTT Broker offerings like the free [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) broker or use this pre-configured [Moquette](https://github.com/andsel/moquette) broker.

Check your Inbox after installation.

## Service Configuration

All parameters are optional and can be set by file or the REST interface (user-interfaces).

* __port__: The port, the embedded broker should run on. Defaults to not set, which means the typical ports 1883 and 8883 (SSL) are used.
* __username__: The user name that clients need to provide to connect to this broker.
* __password__: The password that clients need to provide to connect to this broker.
* __secure__: If set, hosts a secure SSL connection on port 8883 or otherwise a non secure connection on port 1883 (if not overwritten by the port parameter).
* __persistence_file__: An optional persistence file. Retained messages are stored in this file. Can be empty to not store anything. The default is "userdata/mqttembedded.bin". If it starts with "/" on Linux/macOS or with a drive letter and colon (eg "c:/") it will be treated as an absolute path. Be careful to select a path that you have write access to.

## TLS connections

The keystore that is included to allow to start a TLS encrypted connection is generated by:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore serverkeystore.keystore -alias main -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 100000 -deststoretype pkcs12
```

The keystore is embedded into the bundle and cannot be replaced. 

## Plans for the future

* The moquette MQTT broker supports ACL (access control lists), so allows to restrict read/write access per topic per user or client id. That need to be exposed as configuration values at some point.

* Multiple users are supported by the broker software. openHAB does not yet have a user management though.

* The keystore need to be replaceable as soon as openHAB gained a way to configure SSL truststores framework wide.
