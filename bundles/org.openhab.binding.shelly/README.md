## Firmware

To utilize all features the binding requires firmware version 1.5.7 or newer, version 1.6 is strongly recommended.
This should be available for all devices.
Older versions work in general, but have impacts to functionality (e.g. no events for battery powered devices).

The binding displays a WARNING in the log if the firmware is older.
It also informs you when an update is available.
Use the device' web ui or the Shelly App to perform the update.

## Other resources

Check the following resources for additional information


## Discovery

The binding uses mDNS to discover the Shelly devices.
They periodically announce their presence, which is used by the binding to find them on the local network.

Sometimes you need to run the manual discovery multiple times until you see all your devices.

### Dynamic creation of channels

The Shelly series of devices has many combinations of relays, meters (different versions), sensors etc. For this the binding creates various channels dynamically based on the status information provided by the device at initialization time. 
If a channel is missing make sure the thing was discovered correctly and is ONLINE. If a channel is missing delete the thing and re-discover it.

### Important for battery power devices

Make sure to wake up battery powered devices (press the button inside the device), so that they show up on the network.
The device has a push button inside, open the case, press that button and the LED starts blinking.
The device should show up in the Inbox and can be added.

`
Important: If device is in sleep mode and can't be reached by the binding, the Thing will change into UNKNOWN state.
Once the device wakes up, the thing will perform initialization and the state will change to ONLINE.
`

The first time a device is discovered and initialized successfully, the binding will be able to perform auto-initialization when OH is restarted. 
Waking up the device triggers the event URL and/or CoIoT packet, which is processed by the binding and triggers initialization.
Once a device is initialized, it is no longer necessary to manually wake it up after an openHAB restart.

Devices that have no battery are expected to be ON/reachable on the network at all times.
Otherwise the thing will go OFFLINE with COMMUNICATION_ERROR as status.

### Re-discover when IP address has changed
 
Important: The IP address should not be changed after the device is added to openHAB.

This can be achieved by

- assigning a static IP address or
- using DHCP and setup the router to always assign the same IP address to the device

When the IP address changes for a device you need to delete the Thing and then re-discover the device.
In this case channel linkage gets lost and you need to re-link the channels/items.

### Password Protected Devices

The Shelly devices can be configured to require authentication through a user id and password.
In this case you need to set these values in the Thing configuration after approving the Inbox entry.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has the following configuration options:

| Parameter      |Description                                                       |Mandatory|Default                                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| defaultUserId  |Default user id for HTTP authentication when not set in the Thing |    no   |admin                                           |
| defaultPassword|Default password for HTTP authentication when not set in the Thing|    no   |admin                                           |
| autoCoIoT      |Auto-enable CoIoT events when firmware 1.6+ü is enabled           |    no   |true                                            |

The binding defaults to CoIoT events when firmware 1.6 or newer is detected.
This provides near-realtime updates when status values have changed.
This mode also overrules event settings in the thing configuration.
Disabling this feature allows granular control, which event types will be used.
This is also required when the Shelly devices are not located on the same IP subnet (e.g. using a VPN).
In this case autoCoIoT should be disabled, CoIoT events will not work, because the underlying CoAP protocol is based on Multicast IP, which usually doesn't passes a VPN or routed network.

## Channels

### General Notes

- channels `input` and `input1`/`input2` get only updated with firmware 1.5.6+.
- channel button: Short push and long push events require firmware version 1.5.6+.
- Use the channel `rollerpos` only if you need the inverted roller position, otherwise use the `control` channel with item type `Number`
- The different devices have different types of power meters, which are mapped in different sets of channels.

Every device has a channel group `device` with the following channels:

|Group     |Channel            |Type    |read-only|Desciption                                                                       |

|          |accumulatedWatts   |Number  |yes      |Accumulated power in W of the device (including all meters)                      |
|          |accumulatedTotal   |Number  |yes      |Accumulated total power in kw/h of the device (including all meters)             |

The accumulated channels are only available for devices with more than 1 meter. accumulatedReturned only for the EM and 3EM.


### Events / Alarms

The binding provides health monitoring functions for the device.
When an alarm condition is detected the channel alarm gets triggered and provides one of the following alarm types:

### Non-battery powerd devices

|Event Type|Description|
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|RESTARTED   |The device has been restarted. This could be an indicator for a firmware problem.                                |
|WEAK_SIGNAL |An alarm is triggered when RSSI is < -80, which indicates an unstable connection.                                |
|OVER_TEMP   |The device is over heating, check installation and housing.                                                      |
|OVER_LOAD   |An over load condition has been detected, e.g. from the roller motor.                                            |
|OVER_POWER  |Maximum allowed power was exceeded. The relay was turned off.                                                    |
|LOAD_ERROR  |Device reported a load problem, so far Dimmer only.                                                              |

### Shelly 2.5 - roller mode (thing-type: shelly25-roller)

The Shelly 2.5 includes 2 meters, one for each channel.
However, it doesn't make sense to differ power consumption for the roller moving up vs. moving down.
For this the binding aggregates the power consumption of both relays and includes the values in "meter1".

Please note that the settings of channel group color are only valid in color mode and vice versa for white mode.
The current firmware doesn't support the timestamp report for the meters. 
The binding emulates this by using the system time on every update.

In white mode each RGBW2 channel is defined as DimmableLight.
This means that the brightness channel has 2 functions

- Sending ON/OFF (OnOffType) to power on/off the channel
- Sending a Number to set the brightness (percentage 0..100)

Sending brightness 0 will automatically turn off the channel if it's currently on.
Sending brightness > 0 will automatically turn on the channel if it's currently off. 
You can define 2 items (1 Switch, 1 Number) mapping to the same channel, see example rules.
